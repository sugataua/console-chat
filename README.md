# console-chat
It is simple chat for local network.
This client-server application was written in Java.
Simple GUI is based on Swing library.

Entry point to Server part is in Server.java.
Entry point to console client is in Client.java.
Entry point to GUI client is in SwingChatClient.java.

I am still working with this program, it is very raw.
